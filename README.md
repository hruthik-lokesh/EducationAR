# Education Redefined Through Immersive AR

## Project Overview
Our project transforms learning by integrating Augmented Reality (AR) with storytelling, gamified testing, and AI-driven chatbots. Education is redefined in three phases:  
1. Learning – Children explore the solar system with Tom & Jerry, while AR models enhance the experience.  
2. Testing – Knowledge is tested in an interactive AR shooting game.  
3. Guidance – Personalized support is provided by an AI-powered AR chatbot.  

This immersive, AR-driven approach makes learning engaging, fun, and interactive.

## Inspiration
Traditional education often lacks engagement and interactivity. We wanted to bridge this gap by using AR to create an immersive and exciting learning experience.

## Features
- Interactive AR Learning: Explore the solar system with Tom & Jerry and engage with AR models.
- Gamified Testing: Test knowledge through an AR shooting game with space-related questions.
- AI-powered Chatbot: Get real-time learning support from the AR chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- Unity & C# – For AR development.
- AR Foundation – To create engaging AR experiences.
- Convai AI – For AI-driven chatbot interactions.
- Blender – For 3D models of planets and characters.
